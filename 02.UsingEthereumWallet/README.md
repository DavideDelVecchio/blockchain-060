# Connect to a network using the Ethereum Wallet #

The Ethereum Wallet is a useful application that can be used to inspect contracts, accounts, transactions 
and events on the chain. This walk through will step you through using the wallet to deploy and interact with 
a contract.

1. **Install and launch the Ethereum Wallet**

    * Install and launch using PowerShell

            ./00.Setup/windows/LaunchEthereumWallet.ps1
    
    * Manually Download the [Ethereum Wallet]
    * Extract the files
    * Launch "Ethereum Wallet.exe"

    Note that by default if there is no local geth instance running the Ethereum Wallet will launch it's own local
    copy of geth that will by default attempt to connect to the active public network. The wallet may also be switched
    to connect to the test network and enable mining.

2. **Confirm available account exists**

3. **Deploy the Conference contract**

4. **Reserve a conference ticket**

5. **View events from a contract**

6. **View a failed transaction**

## Enjoy !
